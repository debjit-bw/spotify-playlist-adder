## final .py

creates the final playlist. you need to have the [proper environment variables available in your terminal](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.6.3/#authorization-code-flow). you technically can edit some code to create a new playlist rhrough code, but i generally create a playlist at [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/).

it reads from cleaned .txt and searches spotify and adds the first search result into the playlist (playlist_id). beware avout permissions though. the scope "playlist-modify-private" can add only to pvt playlists. change the scope according to your needs.

songs that couldn't be added get added to logs .txt as well as printed onto the terminal.
